# Palindrome Checker

**Palindrome Checker** is a project I created as part of a certification project in **FreeCodeCamp**.

## Project Overview

This web application checks whether a given word or sentence is a palindrome. A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case).

## Features
- Input a word or sentence into the text box.
- Click the "Check" button to determine if the input is a palindrome.
- Handles edge cases, such as ignoring punctuation and spaces.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the functionality to check whether the input is a palindrome.

## Getting Started
